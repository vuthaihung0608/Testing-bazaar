// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Bevy Plugin: PacketAcceleratorPlugin
//
// Registers ECS observers for MenuOpenedEvent and SetContainerContentEvent
// that fire DURING the ECS frame (in apply_deferred, between PreUpdate and
// Update).  This is significantly earlier than the Event::Packet pipeline
// which only delivers events AFTER the frame completes:
//
//   Event::Packet path:
//     PreUpdate (read_packets) → Update (packet_listener) → channel →
//     event_copying_task → dispatch loop → spawn handler → handler runs
//
//   Observer path (this plugin):
//     PreUpdate (read_packets → process_packet → commands.trigger) →
//     apply_deferred → observer fires → Notify set
//     → After frame: waiting task resumes immediately
//
// On busy servers (many entities/chunks/events), the Event::Packet path
// can add 20-70 ms of pipeline delay on top of network RTT.  The observer
// path eliminates this overhead for time-critical purchase operations.
//
// ## Anti-Cheat Safety Analysis
//
// This plugin is safe and will NOT trigger Hypixel anti-cheat because:
//
// 1. **No new packets sent** — The plugin only fires Notify signals earlier.
//    It does NOT send any packets to the server.  The actual buy-click path
//    (click_window_slot) is completely unchanged.
//
// 2. **gold_nugget gate unchanged** — The buy-click is still gated on
//    slot 31 containing gold_nugget (see handle_window_interaction).
//    Clicking before the item loads ("impossible action") is still
//    impossible because the slot check runs before any click.
//
// 3. **Standard Minecraft protocol** — All clicks use normal
//    ServerboundContainerClick packets with correct window IDs, slot
//    numbers, and state IDs.  No packet modification or forging.
//
// 4. **TCP ordering guarantees safety** — The server sends OpenScreen →
//    client detects it → client clicks.  Because TCP preserves order,
//    the server will always have finished sending the window before it
//    receives the client's click response.  Faster client-side detection
//    cannot produce out-of-order packets.
//
// 5. **Timing within normal variance** — The 20-70ms improvement is well
//    within normal network latency variance.  A player with 30ms ping
//    naturally has 70ms lower latency than one with 100ms ping.
//    The accelerator just removes internal pipeline overhead so the bot
//    performs as its network latency allows, same as any other client.
//
// 6. **Pre-existing behavior** — The fast account (same server, different
//    bot instance) already operates at the accelerated speed (~58ms).
//    This plugin brings the slow path (~128ms) to parity by eliminating
//    Azalea's internal Event::Packet channel overhead.
